//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla"
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.

animals.push("Vulture");
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals.push("Elephant");
console.log(animals);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var food = ["grape","walnut","bread","banana","tea"];
console.log(food);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(food.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
food.push("broccoli");
console.log(food);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
food.pop();
console.log(food);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
food.unshift("wine","carrot","brownie");
console.log(food);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
food.shift();
console.log(food);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Reddit has options for users to subscribe to different subreddits. A user's subscribed subreddits could be tracked in an array of subreddits.
// 2: Instagram app maintains my saved posts in a folder. These saved posts could be tracked in an array.
// 3: New York Times app could group news articles into section like opinions, world, U.S., with the use of arrays.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of the project
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "tv";

// Write your conditional here
//I chose to start with the 15% battery left condition because when mapping out the workflow for the conditionals,
//the 15% condition was the most straightforward scenario that can lead to true if answered yes.
//I started my condition with the IF statement because that is the order in which to start.
if(percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
//If the user has 15% battery left or more (conditon is met), the console will log the message "You can call an Uber!"
//If the user does not have 15% battery left (condition is not met), then the code will not run and will move to the following line.
  console.log("You can call an Uber!");
//If the first condition isn't met, the code on this line will check whether this ELSE IF statement is true.
//This statement also corresponds to the second branch of my conditionals workflow:
//If the user does not have 15% battery left, does the user have a charger and is that charger a car charger?
} else if(percentBatteryLeft < 15 && hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car") {
//If the condition is met (returns as true), then the console will log the message, "You can call an Uber!"
  console.log("You can call an Uber!");
//If the above condition is not met (returns as false), then the final ELSE statement will run to capture the final scenario:
//The user does not have any of the following: 15% battery left, charger, charger that is a car charger.
} else {
//The console will log the message, "Sorry, you can't call an Uber right now."
  console.log("Sorry, you can't call an Uber right now.");
}
// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
