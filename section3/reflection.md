## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
```javascript
//I felt more confident in taking those actions by myself because even if I didn't know every step, I knew where to go to get the help I needed.
```

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

New York Times app can group news articles into sections. For example, **Opinions**, **World**, and **U.S.** news articles can be grouped together much easier with the use of arrays.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method stores sets of values as lists. It is dynamic in the sense that values can be added or removed as needed.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

  * A loop checks whether a specified condition is true/false in order for code to execute. A loop typically has multiple conditions to capture intended scenarios. A loop runs until a condition returns false.
  * Loops can be used with arrays when you want to check conditions for multiple values.
  * Loops shouldn't be used with arrays when you don't want to run the same code on array items.  

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
_Your friend Maddie is coming over for a playdate tomorrow and you want to know if she wants to play video games, watch a movie, or play dress-up. A loop is like asking Maddie if she wants to play video games. If she says no then you ask her if she wants to watch a movie. If she says yes, then you watch a movie._

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
 * No questions. Just a comment that I need more practice with both in order to build muscle memory. The syntax is challenging, especially when incorporating arrays into loops.
