## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  * Focus on your progress alone. Don’t get caught up in how others in the class are doing.
  * Struggling is a part of learning so learn to embrace it!

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

* **+** I am trying to stay focused on my own learning and not compare myself to others.
* **+** I am reassuring myself that I can do this when self-doubt starts to creep in.
* **+** When I’m struggling, I’m trying to approach the issue at hand with curiosity.
* **+** If I don’t know something or I’m struggling, I talk to myself the way I would talk to my best friend if she were in my shoes. It’s okay, you’re capable, you have what it takes to get through this, and remember your end goal!!
* **-** I want to practice more. I get caught up in how things work that I run out of time and mental bandwidth to put concept into practice.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

Not having that support felt worrisome at first but also made me more _mindful_ of what I was actually doing because I didn't have prompts to follow. I had to use **muscle memory** and my notes to perform certain things, all of which reinforced my learning through **active recall and repetition**.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement helps a computer decide whether to run a line of code or not. If a condition is met(true), the code runs the statement. If a condition is not met(false), then the code continues to run until it meets the next true condition.

A conditional is likely used when I play a certain artist on Spotify and it recommends similar artists to me.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

Logical operators `&&` and `||` are used to add conditions to an `if` `if else` and `else` statement. If the conditions are
`&&` is the logical **AND** operation is _true_ when all statements are true.
`||` is the logical **OR** operation and is _true_ when at least 1 statement is true.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

`console.log()` allows you to see the result of your code when run in the Terminal with Node.js

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

```javascript
//What is the best way to flowchart a plan when building out these conditionals?
```
