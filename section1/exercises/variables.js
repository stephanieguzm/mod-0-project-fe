In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
to achieve the desired result.

A couple examples that are already completed. Your task is to complete
any remaining prompt.

When navigated to the root of this project directory, you should be able to run this

*/


// EXAMPLE: Write code below to assign Harry Potter's name to a variable and
// log that variable to the console:
var Name = "Harry Potter";
console.log(Name);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below to add 2 to the variable `students` and
// log the result:
var enrolledStudents = 22 + 2;
console.log(enrolledStudents);

// YOU DO:
// Write code below to save the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
// log that variable to the console.
var noReturn = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!";
console.log(noReturn);

// YOU DO:
// Declare three variables, named `firstName`, `isHungry` and `numberOfPets`.
  // Store the appropriate data types in each.
// log all three variables to the console.

//String data type selected for variable firstName because the variable's value is a set of characters.
var firstName = "Stephanie";
//Boolean data type selected for variable isHungry because the variable's value is either true/false.
var isHungry = false;
//Number data type selected for variable numberOfPets because the variable's value is a number.
var numberOfPets = 1;
console.log(firstName);
console.log(isHungry);
console.log(numberOfPets);

// IN WORDS:
// How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
  // Explain.
// *See code annotations above declared variables.

// YOU DO:
// Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different
  // values (but same data type).
// log all three variables to the console.
firstName = "Pedro";
isHungry = true;
numberOfPets = 25;

console.log(firstName);
console.log(isHungry);
console.log(numberOfPets);

// YOU DO:
// Using the variables below, log the total number of snacks to the console:
var healthySnacks = 6;
var junkFoodSnacks = 8;
console.log(healthySnacks + junkFoodSnacks);

// FINAL CHECK

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console
// as you would expect?
